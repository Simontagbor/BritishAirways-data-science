# BritishAirways-data-science
This Project is job simulation for British Airways Data Science role. The project is divided into 3 parts.

## Part 1: Data Analysis
I used numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn libraries to analyse the data. I used jupyter notebook to write the code. The code is in the file `Data Analysis.ipynb`. The code is well documented and easy to understand. The code is divided into 3 parts:
1. Data Cleaning
2. Data Analysis
3. Data Visualization


### Data Cleaning
I cleaned data by removing verification status from each review

### Data Analysis
- I fitted an LDA model to the data and found the top 10 topics
- I found the top 10 words for each topic
- I conductd sentiment analysis on the data and found the top 10 positive and negative words

### Data Visualization
- I visualized the distribuution of the LDA topic model
- I visualized the distribution of the sentiment analysis
